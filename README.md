# Lightweight-SIEM-Detection-Engine
Built a log-ingestion and detection engine that parses syslog-like entries, applies regex-based detection rules, generates structured alerts, and produces HTML reports for SOC review. Demonstrated using synthetic logs (repository: github.com/yourusername/siem-project).
